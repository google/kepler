# Kepler

Kepler is a research project employing machine learning to improve database
query execution time for parameterized queries. By doing so, it attempts to
overcome shortcomings in the query optimizer cost model and cardinality
estimates. To learn more about the project please see our paper on
https://arxiv.org.

The Kepler codebase consists of:
1) Training data collector which gathers empirical query execution
2) Database simulator used simulate query execution to get query execution
latency
3) Model trainer to build and train a model to recommend query plans

Usage for the individual library components can be found in their respective
comment headers.

The examples directory includes a demonstration for how one could use the Kepler
data set and DatabaseSimulator for active learning research to reduce the
training data collection cost of Kepler.
